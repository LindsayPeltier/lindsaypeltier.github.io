#Day 1 

**Hello DevStation**

###Did you have any issues creating a blog?
I did get confused with the Ruby instructions at first. I appreciated the clarificaiton that Jekyll is already a part of GitHub Pages. I think I have everything set up correctly, but I'm about to find out for sure just as soon as I ACP this blog post :)

###How will you spend Thanksgiving this week? 
I **LOVE** Thanksgiving! Although we call it *Friends*giving and the entire neighborhood gets involved. We light up the firepit and it's a full day of hanging out with friends, family, and good food. My husband is smoking 8 turkeys, starting on Tuesday night!
