# Day 06

## What did you work on today?
I never knew there was so much to learn about user stories! It always seemed like such a small detail in our projects. But clearly a well-written user story can make a huge difference to a successful development process-- which of course leads to a more successful product. 

Here's an article that gives 10 tips on writing better [user stories](https://www.romanpichler.com/blog/10-tips-writing-good-user-stories/)

And here's a really nice video that summarizes the Agile process: [Software Development Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L62dd8tJ_b4)

I also finished the Sololearn Javascript course today. It was a solid review opportunity over-all, and for me, it helped to commit some syntax to memory. 

I spent a lot of time today in my data structures course. This course and its sister course in object-oriented programming are both taught using Java. I am grateful for the oppotunity to gain some Java skills, and thanks to stacked learning, I don't feel as though I need to pause these courses until I *know* Java. Instead I just plow through as if it's no big deal...and I am continually reminded that it is in fact not a big deal at all. 

## What will you work on tomorrow?
 - I didn't get to complete the console.log and debugging tutorials today, as planned, so I have moved these to my tomorrow agenda. 
 - At the end of tomorrow, I will be halfway through with Data Structures and Object Oriented programming; 1/3 of the way through Introduction to Computer Science
 - I plan on starting Coursera's Introduction to Programming course tomorrow. This course makes a great compliment to the computer science course- just with more emphasis on coding principles. 
 - There's a quick tutorial on writing better README files that I think will fit in well with what I've covered thus far this week. 

## What did you learn today and/or re-enforce?
I played around with a service called [PivotalTracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/), a project managment program that helps with creating, flushing out, and tracking user stories.
