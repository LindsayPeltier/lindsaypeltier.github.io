## What did you work on today?

Today I worked almost entirely on the 301 review assignment, and I also devoted some of today to pseudocoding.

Pseudocoding was big on my goals list- and I know that that seems like an odd choice, especially when there is so much ground to cover. But I often feel lost somewhere between theory and syntax...and I think stronger pseudocoding skills will help me to close this knowledge gap considerably.

## What do you plan on working tomorrow?

I'll continue working on the 301 assignment, though I probably won't finish until Sunday.

## What did you learn today and/or re-enforce?

I wasn't kidding when I said I was starting on the foundation skills. The funny thing about pseudocoding is that it is absolutely as simplistic as it seems, but there really is a method and process to it. My conclusion is that you can make pseudocoding as complicated and thorough as you want, but to be effective you should only make it as detailed as it needs to be. Pseudocoding is a useful tool to frame your code.

Here's a good presentation on pseudocoding: [pseudocoding](https://www.slideshare.net/DamianGordon1/pseudocode-10373156)
