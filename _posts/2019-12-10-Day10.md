## What did you work on today?

Today I didn't code, but I did think ahead and brought my Introduction to Computer Science textbook. Though I didn't have my computer with me, I was able to read through several chapters and even pseudocode some of the associated assignments. Data structures, data structures, data structures :)

## What do you plan on working tomorrow?

Tomorrow I'll be working on CSS review:

- Wednesday will be CSS styling and SMACSS.
- Thursday I'll focus on FlexBox.
- Friday, Saturday, and Sunday will be devoted to Grid - which is the method in which I want to become the most proficient.

## What did you learn today and/or re-enforce?

Chapters 15 and 17 are devoted to Strings and Arrays, and working through these helped to reinforce arrays as complex, though versatile data types.

Strings have numerous predefined properties and methods:

- Length property returns how many characters are in the string
- toUpperCase and toLowerCase affects the letters of the string - all to upper or lower case
- charAt returns the character stored at a particular index of a string
- substring returns the characters in sequence between a starting and ending indices
